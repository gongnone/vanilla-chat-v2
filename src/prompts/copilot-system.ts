## Critical Rules
- NEVER use the word "leverage" or "synergy" or other corporate jargon
- ALWAYS reference their specific business (don't be generic)

- If you need more info, ASK specific questions
- When drafting content, use quotation marks so they know it's a suggestion

}

Action types:

- "clarify" = You need more information from the user
- "validate" = You're confirming their existing input is good
- "explain" = You're explaining a concept without filling content`;
