# YOUR TASK

Design a complete offer structure with pricing, messaging, and first campaign recommendation.

## 1. Core Offer Definition

Define the core offer that will resonate with the Power 4% avatar:

- **offer_name**: Compelling name that hints at transformation (not generic)
- **target_outcome**: Specific measurable outcome they'll achieve
- **pain_points_solved**: 3-5 specific pain points this solves (from Stage 2)
- **desires_delivered**: 3-5 specific desires this fulfills (from Stage 2)
- **unique_positioning**: How this is positioned differently than competitors

## 2. 3-Tier Pricing Model

Create 3 pricing tiers optimized for the Power 4% segment:

**Tier 1 (Gateway)**: Entry point for those who need to "test the waters"
**Tier 2 (Signature)**: Main offer for the Power 4% - mark with \`is_recommended: true\`
**Tier 3 (Premium)**: For those who want maximum support/speed

For EACH tier provide:
- **tier_number**: 1, 2, or 3
- **tier_name**: Compelling name (e.g., "Accelerator", "VIP Intensive")
- **price**: Exact price with payment structure
- **deliverables**: 5-8 specific deliverables included
- **best_for**: Who this tier is perfect for
- **is_recommended**: true/false (only Tier 2 should be true)

**Pricing Strategy**:
- Tier 1: 40-50% of Tier 2 price (with 40-50% of value)
- Tier 2: Target price ${desired_price_point || 'premium'} with full value stack
- Tier 3: 150-200% of Tier 2 price (with premium bonuses and access)

## 3. Payment Plan Options

Create 2-3 payment plan options to reduce barrier to entry:

For EACH plan provide:
- **name**: Plan name (e.g., "Pay in Full", "3-Month Plan", "6-Month Plan")
- **structure**: Exact payment structure (e.g., "$3,000 upfront then $1,000/month x 6")
- **total_cost**: Total cost over life of plan

**Strategy**: Pay-in-full should save 10-15%, payment plans add 10-20% to total

## 4. 9 Marketing Messages

Create 9 high-converting marketing messages using buyer language from Stage 2:

**3 Pain-Based Messages**: Hook using specific pain/frustration
**3 Desire-Based Messages**: Hook using aspirational outcome
**3 Curiosity-Based Messages**: Hook using intrigue/pattern interrupt

For EACH message provide one headline (10-15 words) that ${stage4.avatar_name} would resonate with.

## 5. Risk-Reversal Guarantee

Create a guarantee that addresses the #1 fear: ${stage2.fear_1}

Provide:
- **guarantee_text**: Full guarantee statement (50-100 words)
- **why_it_works**: Why this guarantee reduces risk and increases conversions

**Not just**: "30-day money-back guarantee"
**But rather**: Outcome-based, conditional, or performance-based guarantee that's hard to abuse but builds massive trust

## 6. Irresistible Bonuses

Create 3 bonuses that increase perceived value, address desires, and speed up results.

For EACH bonus provide:
- **name**: Compelling bonus name
- **value**: Dollar value (e.g., "$497 value")
- **benefit**: One sentence on how it speeds results

## 7. First Campaign Recommendation

Based on ${stage4.avatar_name}'s buying triggers and online communities, recommend the optimal first campaign:

Provide:
- **platform**: Primary platform to launch on (Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Email, etc.)
- **message**: Which message from the 15 to lead with (copy the headline)
- **offer_configuration**: Which tier to promote and which bonuses to emphasize
- **launch_timeline**: Specific timeline (e.g., "Launch Tuesday 8am EST, run for 5 days, close Sunday 11:59pm")

**Based on**: ${stage4.buying_triggers.optimal_contact_days.join(', ')} at ${stage4.buying_triggers.optimal_contact_times.join(' or ')}
