## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use Multi-Stage Mode** - Enable the beta toggle for complete reports with NO placeholders
2. **Be detailed** - More context = better insights (especially important for multi-stage)
3. **Use specific language** - Include exact phrases your customers use
4. **Fill optional fields** - Competitors and current customers add valuable context
5. **Review quality warnings** - Accept them if you're okay with shorter insights
6. **Save your report** - Use copy button to save to your documents
7. **Be patient** - Multi-stage takes 15-20 minutes but delivers professional-quality reports

## Quality Validation

The form includes automatic quality checks:

- ‚úÖ Required field validation
- ‚úÖ Minimum length checks (50+ chars for critical fields)
- ‚úÖ Specificity warnings (e.g., missing income in demographics)
- ‚úÖ Pre-submission quality prompts

## Output Format

Reports are structured markdown with:

- Clear heading hierarchy (H1-H3)
- Tables for data (demographics, language, value stack)
- Bullet points for lists
- Bold for key insights and buyer quotes
- Specific numbers, percentages, prices throughout

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Requires `fetch` API for streaming
- Requires `TextDecoderStream` for response parsing
- Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## Troubleshooting

**"AI binding not available"**
- Deploy to Cloudflare Pages to access Workers AI
- Use `npm run preview:remote` for testing

**"Form validation failed"**
- Fill all required fields (marked with *)
- Ensure minimum lengths for detailed fields

**"Generation taking too long"**
- **Single-Stage:** 8-12 minutes
- **Multi-Stage:** 15-20 minutes (worth the wait for complete data)
- Don't close the browser window during generation
- Check browser console for errors
- Use `wrangler pages deployment tail` to see real-time progress logs

**"Report has placeholder text like [Fear 2] or [Competitor 1]"**
- This happens with single-stage generation when token limits are exceeded
- **Solution:** Enable "Use Beta Multi-Stage Generation" toggle
- Multi-stage guarantees NO placeholders - every section filled with real data

**"Multi-stage stuck on a stage"**
- Each stage has 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff
- Check browser console for error messages
- Check `wrangler pages deployment tail` for backend errors
- If persistent, refresh and try again (form data is saved in LocalStorage)

**"Report cut off or too short"**
- Ensure you're using multi-stage mode for complete reports
- Check logs to confirm all 6 stages completed
- Single-stage limited to 8,000 tokens and may be incomplete

## Future Enhancements

Potential upgrades (not currently implemented):

- KV storage for report persistence
- User accounts and report history
- PDF export functionality
- Email delivery of completed reports
- Progress indicators during generation
- Pause/resume capability (requires Workflows)
- Multiple report versions for A/B testing
