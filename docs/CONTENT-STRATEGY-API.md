### Required Fields

**Minimum Required**:
- `context` - All 16 business context fields
- `stage1` - Complete market analysis data
- `stage2` - Complete buyer psychology data (top fears, desires, language)

**Recommended (Not Required)**:
- `stage7` - Offer rationale with unique mechanism
- `stage8` - Value stack components

**Why Offer Data is Recommended**: Including `stage7` and `stage8` aligns content pillars with your unique mechanism and offer positioning, creating more targeted and effective content strategy. Without offer data, pillars are still high-quality but more generic.

Your pillars are rooted in buyer psychology (addressing specific fears around being found out, hitting a ceiling, and burning out) rather than generic topics. The Authority Building and Industry Insights pillars position you as a thought leader who understands systemic issues, not just individual tactics. And your Transformation Stories provide proof that your approach works specifically for women in tech, not just anyone seeking leadership development."

## Token Budget

### Context Window Limit

**Total Available**: 24,000 tokens

**Typical Breakdown**:
- Business Context: ~300 tokens

## Performance

### Response Times

**Typical**:
- Generation: 3-4 minutes
- Network latency: <500ms
- **Total**: 3-4 minutes

**Maximum Observed**:
- Generation: 6-7 minutes (peak AI load)

## Integration Examples

### JavaScript/TypeScript

```typescript
async function generateContentStrategy(data: ContentStrategyRequest): Promise<ContentPillarStrategy> {
  const response = await fetch('/api/content/stage/17', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    const error = await response.json();
    throw new Error(error.message);
  }

  return await response.json();
}

// Usage
const strategy = await generateContentStrategy({
  context: { /* business context */ },
  stage1: { /* market analysis */ },
  stage2: { /* buyer psychology */ }
});

console.log(`Generated ${strategy.pillar_count} pillars`);
strategy.pillars.forEach(pillar => {
  console.log(`- ${pillar.pillar_name} (${pillar.frequency_percentage}%)`);
});
```

### Python

```python
import requests
import json

def generate_content_strategy(data):
    url = "https://vanilla-chat-demo-tmpl-al4.pages.dev/api/content/stage/17"
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data, timeout=600)
    response.raise_for_status()

    return response.json()

# Usage
strategy = generate_content_strategy({
    "context": { # business context },
    "stage1": { # market analysis },
    "stage2": { # buyer psychology }
})

print(f"Generated {strategy['pillar_count']} pillars")
for pillar in strategy['pillars']:
    print(f"- {pillar['pillar_name']} ({pillar['frequency_percentage']}%)")
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Include Complete Data

**Do**: Include all required fields with complete, accurate data
**Don't**: Send partial or placeholder data

**Why**: AI quality depends on data quality. Incomplete data = generic output.

### 2. Include Offer Data When Available

**Do**: Include `stage7` and `stage8` for aligned content strategy
**Don't**: Omit offer data if you have it

**Why**: Offer data aligns content with your unique mechanism, creating more targeted pillars.

### 3. Handle Long Generation Times

**Do**: Show progress indicators, allow 5-7 minutes before timeout
**Don't**: Use aggressive timeouts (<3 minutes)

**Why**: AI generation is inherently variable in time. Premature timeouts cause failed requests.

### 4. Validate Responses Gracefully

**Do**: Log validation warnings but use response anyway
**Don't**: Reject responses that slightly deviate from specs

**Why**: AI may occasionally generate 6 pillars or 95% frequency sum. Still usable content.

### 5. Cache Responses

**Do**: Store responses in LocalStorage or database for reuse
**Don't**: Regenerate on every page load

**Why**: Regeneration costs $0.02 and takes 3-4 minutes. Cache for efficiency.

### 6. Export for Backup

**Do**: Provide JSON export functionality to users
**Don't**: Rely solely on browser storage

**Why**: LocalStorage can be cleared. Exports provide backup and portability.
