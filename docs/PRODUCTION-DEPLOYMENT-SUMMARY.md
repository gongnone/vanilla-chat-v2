## üì¶ Work Completed

### Critical Bug Fixes (Commit: `c1a854e`)

**Issue**: Stage 6 (Report Synthesis) failing with 500 errors

**Root Causes**:
1. Property mapping errors - TypeScript types vs runtime flat JSON mismatch
2. Model stream compatibility - Llama 3.3 incompatible with TextDecoderStream

**Files Modified**:
- `src/prompts/stage6-report-synthesis-condensed.ts` (343 lines, complete rewrite)
- `src/index.tsx` (1 line, model change)

**Result**: All 6 stages now complete successfully, 100% report completion rate

### Documentation Reorganization (Commit: `010a314`)

**Changes**:
- Created `docs/` directory with professional structure
- Consolidated 5 debug files into production changelog
- Archived historical documentation for reference
- Updated CLAUDE.md with documentation index

**New Structure**:
```
docs/
  README.md                     - Documentation index

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Verify build output
ls -lh dist/_worker.js

# Deploy
npx wrangler pages deploy dist
```

### Post-Deployment Verification

1. Navigate to: `https://vanilla-chat-demo-tmpl-al4.pages.dev/research`
2. Click **"üß™ Fill Test Data"**
3. Enable **"Multi-Stage Generation"**
4. Click **"Generate Research Report"**
5. Verify all 6 stages complete successfully
6. Verify final report quality (no placeholders)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Known Behaviors

1. **Retry Logic**: Stages 2 and 5 may occasionally retry (1-2 times) due to:
   - Stage 2: AI returns non-JSON preamble (auto-retries)
   - Stage 5: Timeout after 45s (auto-retries with extended timeout)
   - **This is expected** and handled automatically

2. **Token Budget**: Stage 6 uses 18,084 tokens (75% of 24K limit)
   - Input: ~6,084 tokens
   - Output: 12,000 tokens
   - Buffer: 5,916 tokens (24.7% safety margin)

3. **Model Consistency**: All stages now use `@cf/meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct`
   - Proven stream compatibility
   - Consistent behavior across stages

### Future Improvements

See [docs/STAGE6-BUGFIX-CHANGELOG.md](docs/STAGE6-BUGFIX-CHANGELOG.md) "Future Improvements" section for:
- Type system alignment recommendations
- Testing infrastructure suggestions
- Monitoring & observability enhancements
- Performance optimization opportunities
